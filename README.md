# Weather App

This is an app I made using [Open Weather App](https://openweathermap.org/api/one-call-api) to fetch the current weather as well as the weather forecast for the upcoming week.

## Overview
This app displays the weather in the user's current location, a location they've searched for, as well as the weather in 5+ random cities around the world!

In order to make this something I'd love to use myself, I worked with various color palettes and tweaked the design until I found one that fit myself and my personality best. Yes, it's touch√©, but I love pink!

I'm obsessed with the look of this app, but I do plan to eventually return to this and add some more advanced front end features.
